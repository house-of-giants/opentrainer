# Contributing to OpenTrainer

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get involved.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fix/thing-you-fixed`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues
5. Open a PR

## What We're Looking For

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Accessibility improvements
- Documentation fixes
- New features (please open an issue first to discuss)

## Guidelines

**Keep it simple.** This app is intentionally minimal. We'd rather do fewer things well than many things poorly.

**Match the existing style.** Look at how similar code is written and follow that pattern.

**Test your changes.** Make sure the app still works. We don't have automated tests yet (contributions welcome!) but manually verify your changes.

**Write clear commit messages.** One line summary, present tense. "Fix rest timer not vibrating" not "Fixed the bug where the timer wasn't working".

## Opening Issues

**Bugs:** Include steps to reproduce, what you expected, what happened instead, and your browser/device.

**Features:** Explain the problem you're trying to solve, not just the solution you want. We might have a simpler approach.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Link to the issue if there is one.
- Update documentation if needed.
